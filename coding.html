							<h5 class="text-uppercase" style="color: white;">Early Detection of Glioblastoma Multiforme Brain Cancer through the Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks on MRI Imaging</h5>
							<p>
								Despite great advances in the field of oncology, glioblastoma multiformeâ€™s extreme aggression still results in a grim prognosis. A median survival length of a mere 11-15 months, couples with one of the lowest survival rates of all cancers, at ~4%.
								<br><br>Simultaneously, detection models have made great progress with non-small cell lung cancer and Alzheimer's in the medical diagnostics industry, while the current conventional detection of brain tumors involves human inspection of radiological imagery for tissue abnormalities. Our project aims to utilize convolutional neural networks on MR imaging for the same purpose. Work was primarily split into three categories: data extraction and preprocessing of imagery, convolutional neural network training, and the machine learning classification period.
								<br><br>The automation of early-stage tumor detection drastically reduces the workload of radiologists, aids with patient outcomes through earlier treatment, and may provide insight into the characteristics of high-grade astrocytomas. MR Imaging and ML algorithms look promising regarding their potential applications in the medical field, particularly in the field of medical diagnoses.
								<br><br>This project has finished training Model-11. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/FrankWhoee/Aura/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
								to view the accuracy and loss.

								In our current traffic system, congestion has become a major problem. However, the problem of traffic creates a dilemma for governments as they often cannot afford to construct more roads due to their high cost and maintenance fees. Furthermore, paving new roads can lead to habitat segregation and environmental damage as large areas of landscape are cleared for their construction. As the demand for transportation grows, the problem of continued traffic congestion will inevitably follow the demand. To attempt to solve this problem, we set out to find the optimal and most efficient road system through simulated swarm intelligence as it would allow a smoother flow of traffic with the same construction and maintenance costs.
								<br><br>In our search for the answer to congestion, we coded a digital environment to simulate the flow of traffic with differing types of road systems.  Each car has an objective and uses a typical breadth-first path-finding algorithm to navigate to its set destination. Furthermore, as our end goal was to create a program that could be feasibly used within real life scenarios, we implement the feature to create customized road networks to simulate traffic in cities. Due to the nature of computerized simulations, we had the ability to monitor and control each individual variable very precisely. This allowed us to maintain a very high level of consistency between each one of the trials.
								<br><br>The grid system, orbital system and tributary trees were tested to see which one was the most efficient. Each system was simulated 24 times, each one for a total of 30 001 ticks. After each trial, all the conditions would be reset so as not to affect future trials. Time was also kept to keep track of the performance of each trial.
								<br><br>The results prove that the grid system is the most efficient road system as it had an average of 4.125 cars remaining at 30 001 ticks. In comparison, the orbital system had an average of 12.167 cars remaining and the tributary trees had 41.75 cars remaining. Observing the simulation, we could determine that the cars in the grid system had a variety of routes that allowed each individual car to have multiple paths at its disposal. Overall, this allowed the grid system to perform the best that supports our original hypothesis.

								Stride is a machine learning project based on security. To protect against theft, we built an app that could track your
								phone's accelerometer data to determine who is carrying the phone. If the walking patterns are not consistent with the
								owner's walking pattern, the phone will alert the owner's smart watch. The core technology is the neural network that can
								identify the person walking, which can be applied to many smart devices, provided they have accelerometers. In the future,
								we hope to embed this in a tag that can be placed with bags, backpacks, wallets, etc. to protect your valuable belongings.
